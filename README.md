# Predicting Batsman Shot Selection in T20 Death Overs Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Cricket has undergone significant changes in the 21st century, with T20 cricket emerging as a global phenomenon due to its fast-paced nature and thrilling action. This project focuses on the critical final overs of T20 matches, where a batsman's shot selection can drastically impact the match's outcome. By employing machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict the shot selection of batsmen during these high-pressure moments.

## Key Features
- **Objective**: To predict a batsman's shot selection during the death overs of T20 matches.
- **Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset sourced from **ESPN Cricinfo** and **Cricsheet.org**, containing:
  - Ball-by-ball commentary
  - Delivery outcomes
  - Ball types
  - Shot types
  - Required run rates, and more.
- **Methodology**:
  - **Ensemble Techniques**: Utilized to improve model performance metrics.
  - **Explainable AI (SHAP)**: Applied to analyze the influence of features on prediction outcomes.
- **Impact**: Provides valuable insights for cricket teams to enhance game analysis and strategic planning, especially during the second innings.
